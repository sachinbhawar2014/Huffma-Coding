**Huffman Coding Compression and Decompression Tool**

Project Overview: Developed a comprehensive Huffman Coding tool in Python, leveraging the principles of data compression and decompression to optimize data storage and transmission.
Key Features:
Implemented a Huffman Tree data structure to efficiently encode and decode text data, significantly reducing file sizes.
Utilized Python's heapq library to manage the priority queue required for building the Huffman Tree, ensuring optimal performance.
Designed for both compression and decompression processes, allowing users to easily compress text files into binary format and decompress them back to their original form.
Incorporated error handling and validation to ensure the integrity of the compressed and decompressed data.
Integrated file handling capabilities to read from and write to files, enabling the tool to process large datasets efficiently.
Technologies Used: Python, heapq library for priority queue management, and file handling for reading and writing data.
Challenges Overcame:
Successfully managed the complexity of Huffman Coding algorithms, including the construction of the Huffman Tree, encoding, and decoding processes.
Ensured the tool's robustness by implementing comprehensive error handling and validation mechanisms.
Outcome: The project showcased my ability to apply advanced algorithms in Python, demonstrating my proficiency in data structures, algorithms, and file handling. It also highlighted my skills in problem-solving and optimization techniques.
